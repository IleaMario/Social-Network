# SocialNetwork
The project developed over the course of a semester in Java represents a complex simulation of a social network, where we applied object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, used the Observer pattern, integrated a graphical user interface (GUI), and applied some CSS concepts for styling the user interface. This application was designed to provide an interactive and engaging experience for users, offering functionalities such as sending and accepting friend requests, as well as sending messages between users.

# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)
Within the project, we applied OOP principles to create a modular and easily maintainable structure. We defined classes for users, friend relationships, messages, and other entities relevant to the social network. By using inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism, we organized the code in a clear and efficient manner, facilitating the extension and subsequent modification of functionalities.

# Observer Pattern
The Observer pattern was implemented to manage events and updates within the social network. We used this pattern to notify users about received friend requests or new messages. Thus, users are always informed about changes in their network of friends and can interact accordingly.

# Graphical User Interface (GUI)
The graphical user interface played a crucial role in the interaction between the user and the application. We created windows, buttons, input fields, and other interface elements using the JavaFX graphics library. By applying some CSS concepts, we styled these components to provide a pleasant and cohesive experience for users. The intuitive and attractive graphical interface facilitates users' navigation and interaction with the simulated social network.

# Data Persistence
In addition to the aforementioned features, we also incorporated data persistence using a database. This allowed us to store user information, friend relationships, and messages persistently, ensuring that data is retained even after the application is closed. By integrating database functionality, we enhanced the scalability and robustness of our social network simulation.

# Main Functionalities
The main functionalities of the application include the ability to send friend requests to other users and to accept or reject received friend requests. Additionally, we implemented a messaging system that allowed users to send and receive messages among themselves. The functionalities are accessible to users through a clear and intuitive navigation system, optimizing the user experience in interacting with the social network.

# Login Functionality
An essential aspect of our application is the login functionality, which allows users to access the simulated social network. Users need to provide valid credentials (such as username and password) to authenticate and gain access to the features of the social network. The implementation of this functionality adds a level of security and customization to the user experience, ensuring that only authorized individuals have access to the information and functionalities of the social network. Thus, login is a critical element of our project, ensuring that users' interaction with the social network is safe and controlled.

# Testing and Debugging
During development, we paid particular attention to testing and debugging to ensure that our application works correctly and without errors. We used unit testing and integration testing techniques to verify each functionality and interaction in the application. Thus, we ensured that users benefit from a reliable and seamless experience in using the simulated social network.

# Conclusion
In conclusion, this Java project was a valuable opportunity to apply and deepen our knowledge of object-oriented programming and to develop a practical and engaging application. We succeeded in creating a realistic simulation of a social network, offering users an interactive and enjoyable experience. The implementation of login functionalities, together with the other features of the application, contributed to creating a comprehensive and satisfying experience for users.
